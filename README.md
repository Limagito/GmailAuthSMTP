# GmailAuthSMTP
This project is a very basic demo showing how to authenticate with OAUTH2 and send an email message.

You will need to create a file called GmailGlobals.pas which contains the following constants

clientid
clientsecret
clientscope
clientredirect
clientaccount
clientsendtoaddress
clientname

With some further work, this could be further improved to remove some of the required constants and improving some of the error handling.

Thanks
